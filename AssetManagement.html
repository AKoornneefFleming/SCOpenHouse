        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> SAWC’s Operations team was interested in standardizing the use of spatial data in the management of their 
                    critical assets and life safety equipment, with offline capabilities. This would support ongoing monitoring, maintenance, 
                    and inspections; better enabling operations, emergency management, business continuity planning, as well as future research projects. </p>
             </div>

        <!-- ########## METHODOLOGY LIFE SAFETY ################ -->
        <div class = "titles">
            <h2>Methodology - Life Safety Equipment</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">Life safety equipment is inspected every year at SAWC, with over 200 unique pieces of equipment spread across the campus. 
                    Inspections are conducted with paper logs, unaided by spatial data, and the ability to effectively complete inspections 
                    in a timely manner is largely dependent on staff's knowledge and memory. 
                </p>

                <p class = "p1">Field technicians guided the Safari Consulting team across the campus, 
                    identifying the location of fire horns, whose location was captured using the Field Maps. It was not possible to collect the data for all
                    fire equipment, but Safari Consulting conducted random spot checks for other equipment types, as time allowed. This gave us a base of data to 
                    begin building a solution with, with the intention for the client to continue collecting data with the solution we created. 
                </p>
 
                <p class = "p1">New feature classes were built for each type of fire equipment (extinguishers, hoses, hydrants, and horns). The feature classes 
                    were designed with a schema that included a field for each question on the inspection forms. 
                    Domains were created and assigned to simplify collection, and field sizes were customized based on the required length. 
                    All the feature classes were placed in a feature dataset called Life_Safety, within the Staff FGDB, of the SAWC FGDB Library. 
                    Also included in the feature dataset were fire breaks and emergency assembly areas.
                </p>

                    <!-- Feature Dataset Picture -->

                    </div>

                <p class = "p1">Once the organization of the Life Safety feature dataset was complete, the feature classes were exported to SAWC’s 
                    AGOL account as hosted feature layers, placed in a single web map, against the backdrop of the staff basemap created by the Safari Consulting team. 
                    Extinguisher, hose, hydrant, and horn symbology was applied to the inspection status field, to distinguish what needed to be placed and/or confirmed. 
                    Settings for the data were customized to allow for offline mode and for staff editing.The web map was configured within Field Maps Designer, where inspection forms were 
                    created for the life safety equipment based on the corresponding data’s schema, and an offline map extent was generated.

         <!-- ########## METHODOLOGY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (CI) ################ -->
         <div class = "titles">
            <h2>Methodology - Critical Infrastructure</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">Critical infrastructure is maintained by SAWC’s operational staff across the campus. 
                    This includes features such as freshwater pipes and connections, sewage pipes and connections, water tanks, electric kiosks, 
                    generators, fiber optic cables, etc. The operations team was interested in having this information available in web solutions 
                    for viewing and maintaining information related to this equipment’s locations. 
                </p>
 
                <p class = "p1">Operations staff guided Safari Consulting around campus to collect spatial records for data including but 
                    not limited to transformers, generators, kiosks, and circuit breakers. Other critical infrastructure that already had existing spatial data, was also visited 
                    with a project liaison, to review and provide contextual information. 
                </p>


                <p class = "p1">There was also a large amount of existing spatial data in various formats (gpx, kml, csv, etc.) and folders. It was imported into GIS to be converted, 
                    reviewed, and cleaned. Type or subcategory fields were added to allow applicable data 
                    sets to be merged and the the number of existing files to be simplified. 
                    Duplicate and overlapping datasets were merged, with conflicts noted for data owner review in the comments field.               
                </p>

                <p class = "p1">The critical infrastructure was exported to AGOL as hosted feature layers and included in a web map 
                    and configured for online and offline use in Field Maps. A key distinction in this approach was the use of intermediary ‘Field Update’ layers, 
                    instead of making the source critical infrastructure data editable. The use of these separate layers allows the data owner to review field observations, 
                    perform quality assurance and quality control (QAQC), and determine the appropriate updates to the SAWC File Geodatabase and SAWC AGOL account. 
                    The name, type, and subcategory fields, in addition to campus rooms and building rooms, were made searchable in the web map for use in the field.

        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">Two digital solutions were produced in Fields Maps for online and offline use by SAWC’s operations staff. 
                    The ‘Operations: Fire Inspection Map’ and the ‘Operations: Critical Infrastructure Maintenance Map’ are configured and hosted in 
                    Field Maps and ready for use by SAWC staff. Both solutions allow for rapid dissemination of observations between field technicians 
                    in the field, and leadership in office that need to coordinate and make decisions with the available information. 
                    All the available and applicable data can be found in an organized environment, with pre-defined symbology, and a 
                    customized basemap. Both the web maps are available for online and offline viewing on field technicians’ mobile devices, 
                    within AGOL, or in ArcGIS Pro, through use of the organization’s AGOL portal.
