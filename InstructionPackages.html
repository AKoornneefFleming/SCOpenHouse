            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> To ensure the success of SAWC’s future GIS projects, our team created several instruction packages. 
                    The instruction packages will allow the SAWC staff to efficiently 
                    maintain the delivered solutions and create similar GIS products themselves.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> To support the client in maintaing each of the delivaried solutions, the team created several tutorial-style documents to walk
                    SAWC staff through the basics of creating and modifying relevent GIS items. Each of the instruction packages were created by following the
                    same general workflow, which began by documenting relevant proccessses while creating the deliverable solutions, then formating the documentation 
                    into topics and categories, and finally compiling the topics and formatting them accordingly. 
                </p>

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> For the public-facing solutions, hosted feature layer views were created to display data with sensitive attributes. For example,
                    Fire Extinguisher data had records outside of the campus and fields describing when the equipment was last serviced, which was information
                    the public did not need to know. Setting visibility extents and deleting sensitive fields, we were able to make the Fire Extinguisher layer 
                    appropriate for public consumption.
