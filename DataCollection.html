                <p class = "p1"> An efficient strategy for on-site data collection was imperative to the success of 
                    the collaborative project, as every deliverable is dependent on the availability of quality spatial data. </p>

        <div class = "titles">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">To maximize time and effort on location, the team created feature classes for data collection, 
                    hosted as ArcGIS web maps (web map) in AGOL and accessed through ArcGIS Field Maps (Field Maps). 
                    Domains, Field Map surveys, and offline map extents were created to help streamline collection while in the field, 
                    even during the frequent power outages and loss of network service. In some cases, existing spatial data provided 
                    by the client while Safari Consulting was on-site was also added to the web map, for in-field verification (e.g. fire extinguishers, buildings and rooms).
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class = "p3">ArcGIS Pro Feature Class attribute table, domain and fields table.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">A second component to data acquisitions was the organization and review 
                    of the existing spatial data, which was provided by the client upon our on-site arrival. Data existed in a  myriad of locations and formats.
                    The scope and types of available raw data needed to be interpreted and understood before it could be cleaned and incorporated into the rest of the project deliverables.
                </p>
            </div>



        <!-- ########## RESULTS ################ -->
        <div class = "titles">
            <h2>Results</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">The use of offline web maps in Field Maps, with the generic data collection layers and applicable provided spatial data 
                    included, helped the team collect new records and verify existing records across the 83-acre campus 
                    Some in-field collection took place with members of the SAWC staff to locate and contextualize points of interest, and to 
                    better understand the use-case for data. Sufficient spatial data was gathered from the client and cleaned to support the remaining deliverables.
