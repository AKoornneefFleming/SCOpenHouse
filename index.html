                <p class = "p1">Southern African Wildlife College (SAWC) has been proudly operating for 26 years with the aim of meeting training needs for natural resource management.  
                    Situated within Kruger National Park, SAWC offers a variety of educational services on the topics of conservation, 
                    wildlife management, anti-poaching, and community development. The school also offers supporting services that are integral 
                    to the management of the park system itself (SAWC Annual Report, 2021).</p>

                    including more than 14,000 field rangers, and 1,200 natural resource managers from over 
                    56 countries and 127 wildlife areas (SAWC website).</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <h3>Ideal: </h3>
                <p class = "p1"> A cartographically pleasing basemap and application solutions that support on and 
                    off campus navigation, life safety, asset management, marketing material and relevant research projects. 
                    These should be built upon a well-organized data structure. These solutions should be reliable enough to adapt 
                    to both online and offline scenarios where applicable, and straightforward enough to be maintained and taught by 
                    campus staff in support of the existing longitudinal studies. 
                </p>
                <h3>Reality: </h3>
                <p class = "p1"> The only existing basemaps for the campus are rudimentary and lacking detail. Current GIS datasets require further 
                    development and organization. There are no significant digital navigation solutions available, 
                    with or without resilience to load shedding.
                </p>
                <h3>Consequences: </h3> 
                <p class = "p1"> It is difficult for visitors to navigate around the campus, and they often get lost. 
                    Additional GIS work is difficult to develop without sufficient basemap or operational layers, and services are lost during load shedding. 
                    There is significant risk of information loss regarding critical infrastructure, 
                    and it would be difficult to identify or communicate the location of life safety equipment or assets during an emergency. 
                </p>
                <h3>Proposal: </h3>
                <p class = "p1"> Collect and organize sufficient data to support the development of a basemap and operational layers, 
                    that can be integrated into online and offline solutions that meet the client’s use-cases. 
                </p>

            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1">Safari Consulting, worked with Southern African Wildlife College to learn about and fulfill their 
                    current objectives, by leveraging GIS technologies to deliver quality geospatial solutions. 
                    The seven deliverable solutions include data acquisition, file geodatabase development, custom basemaps, 
                    ArcGIS StoryMaps templates, navigation solutions, asset management solutions, and GIS instruction packages. 
                    These deliverables were built over a six-week period, with a one-week phase of data acquisition and a 
                    five-week phase of project development. These solutions will ultimately help the college in a variety of meaningful 
                    ways including (but not limited to) data organization and management, visualization of the 
                    college and their research areas, asset management, and establishing a foundation for future their GIS projects.
