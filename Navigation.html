            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> A primary objective of Safari Consulting was to help visitors and staff easily navigate the campus 
                    and the surrounding areas. These navigation solutions needed to be available even when network service was not.
                    Several solutions were produced to achieve this objective.
                  </p>
            </div>

        <!-- ########## METHODOLOGY ################ -->
        <div class = "titles">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
        </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> To support both online and offline navigation of the SAWC campus, the team created several solution options. Each of the options 
                    followed the same general workflow, which initially started by configuring a map in ArcGIS Online or Pro with the appropriate layers and 
                    customized base map, then brining the map(s) into an application which was either an AcrGIS Experience Builder, Field Maps or Microsoft 
                    publisher, and finally configuring and formatting that map and application with the appropriate settings.
                </p>
            </div>

                <img class = "port_photos_no_outline" src="./Images/NavWorkflow.png" alt="Workflow to create the navigation solutions" style="width:700px; height:auto">
            </div> 

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p3">General workflow to create the navigation solutions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "text">
                <p class = "p1"> For the public-facing solutions, hosted feature layer views were created to display data with sensitive attributes. For example,
                    Fire Extinguisher data had records outside of the campus and fields describing when the equipment was last serviced, which was information
                    the public did not need to know. Setting visibility extents and deleting sensitive fields, we were able to make the Fire Extinguisher layer 
                    appropriate for public consumption.
